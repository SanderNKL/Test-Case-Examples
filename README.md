# Test-Case-Examples
The intent of this repository is to showcase how tests work for Javascript, Python, C# and Typescript.
This is used to show some friends and collegues of mine how to do certain tests, and why they are important.
It also serves as a repository where I can experiment and play around with things for fun.
